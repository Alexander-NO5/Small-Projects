#In some online multiplayer games, there's a KDA ratio to evaluate a player's in-game performance:

#KDA=(k+a)/d

#k is how many players you took down.
#d is how many times you died.
#a is how many assists you had.
#Write a kda() function that takes in parameters: k, d, a.

#This function should calculate and return the KDA ratio that uses these paremeters.

def kda(k, d, a):
  kda = (k + a) / d
  return kda

print(kda(20, 10, 15))
